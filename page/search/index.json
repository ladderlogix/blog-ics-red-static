[{"content":"My Homelab: A Cybersecurity Professional\u0026rsquo;s Hardware Paradise Welcome to my homelab - a carefully crafted environment that serves as both my learning playground and professional development space. What started as a simple setup has evolved into a comprehensive infrastructure that supports everything from virtualization and networking to industrial control systems and hardware hacking.\n[Image placeholder: Overview shot of the entire homelab setup]\nThe Heart of Operations: Central Server Rack My homelab is anchored by a compact central server rack that houses the core networking and compute infrastructure. This rack serves as the nerve center for all operations.\nCore Infrastructure HPE ProLiant DL350 Gen10: My primary ESXi hypervisor server, handling the majority of virtual machines and services 4TB SSD NAS: Connected via 10Gb link for high-speed external storage, providing fast access to VM datastores and backup storage Cisco 2960L Switch: The main distribution switch that aggregates connections to all devices throughout the lab pfSense Firewall: My primary security gateway connecting to the ISP, providing advanced firewall capabilities, VPN access, and network segmentation Wireless Access Point: Ensuring wireless connectivity throughout the lab space [Image placeholder: Close-up of the central server rack showing the organized cable management and equipment]\nThe 10Gb connection between the ESXi host and NAS ensures that storage doesn\u0026rsquo;t become a bottleneck for VM performance, while the Cisco switch provides enterprise-grade switching with VLAN capabilities for network segmentation.\nThe Workshop: Full-Height Server Rack \u0026amp; Workbench Recently, I expanded my setup with a full-height server rack that doubles as my primary workbench. This addition has transformed my capability to work on hardware projects and conduct hands-on security research.\nPower and Safety Controls At the top of the rack sits an SEL-351S protective relay, a professional-grade power system protection device that controls the bench power through a breaker system while providing comprehensive monitoring. This ensures safe operation of all equipment and allows me to practice with industrial-grade protection systems.\n[Image placeholder: SEL-351S relay unit and power distribution setup]\nHardware Hacking Station The workbench portion is equipped for serious hardware analysis and modification:\nDigital Oscilloscope: For signal analysis and reverse engineering Soldering station and precision tools: For component-level work Logic analyzers and multimeters: For circuit analysis Anti-static workspace: Proper ESD protection for sensitive components [Image placeholder: Workbench setup with oscilloscope, tools, and current project]\nThis space allows me to dive deep into hardware security, firmware analysis, and IoT device research - skills that are increasingly valuable in cybersecurity.\nIndustrial Control Systems (ICS) Laboratory One of the most unique aspects of my homelab is the dedicated ICS wall - a plywood-mounted display of industrial control systems that provides hands-on experience with operational technology (OT) security.\n[Image placeholder: Full view of the ICS wall showing all mounted devices]\nCurrent ICS Equipment Arduino OPTA: A modern industrial-grade programmable logic controller that bridges IT and OT worlds Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1100: A classic PLC commonly found in industrial environments Cisco ISA Firewall: Specialized security appliance for industrial networks Honeywell Cipher 50: Industrial communication and control device Schneider Electric PLC: Additional programmable logic controller for diverse testing scenarios [Image placeholder: Close-up shots of individual ICS components]\nThis setup allows me to:\nPractice ICS security assessment techniques Test industrial protocol analysis tools Experiment with OT network segmentation Develop skills in both offensive and defensive ICS security Network Security and Monitoring Security monitoring is integrated throughout the infrastructure with Security Onion running on VMware, connected to a span port on the Cisco switch. This provides comprehensive network visibility and allows me to:\nMonitor all network traffic for suspicious activity Practice with enterprise security tools Develop custom detection rules Analyze attack patterns and techniques [Image placeholder: Security Onion dashboard or network monitoring display]\nWhy This Setup Matters This homelab represents more than just a collection of hardware - it\u0026rsquo;s a comprehensive learning environment that spans:\nEnterprise IT: Through virtualization and networking infrastructure Cybersecurity: Via monitoring, analysis, and testing capabilities Industrial Security: Through the ICS laboratory components Hardware Security: Via the dedicated workbench and analysis tools The combination allows me to develop skills across the full spectrum of cybersecurity domains, from traditional IT security to the growing field of OT/ICS security.\nFuture Expansion Plans I\u0026rsquo;m always looking to expand and improve the lab. Current plans include:\nAdding more diverse ICS equipment from different manufacturers Implementing additional network segments for more complex scenarios Expanding the hardware analysis capabilities Adding more storage capacity for long-term data retention [Image placeholder: Future equipment or expansion area]\nConclusion Building and maintaining this homelab has been an incredible journey in both technical learning and hands-on skill development. It provides a safe space to experiment, learn, and push the boundaries of what\u0026rsquo;s possible in cybersecurity research and education.\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;re just starting your cybersecurity journey or looking to expand into specialized areas like ICS security, I encourage you to start building your own lab environment. Start small, grow gradually, and most importantly - have fun learning!\nHave questions about any of the equipment or setup? Feel free to reach out - I\u0026rsquo;m always happy to discuss homelab builds and cybersecurity infrastructure.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.ics.red/posts/homelab/","title":"Homelab"},{"content":"https://bucket.ics.red/StephenGlombicki_Sept9.pdf\n","date":"2025-05-16T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.ics.red/posts/resume/","title":"Resume"},{"content":"This was a powerpoint slides for a presentation I gave to CvCISO coffee talk.
